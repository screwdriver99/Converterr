# Converterr
A script for automatically transcode all movies in a collection to a default video and audio stream format.

This script can be used in conjunction with Radarr and Sonarr software 
to always have the same audio and video format (resolution, bitrate, channels number, codec, etc), 
so that another streaming software (e.g. Jellyfin) can stream any element in the collection without transcoding.

The script may be invoked by a unit file every day or manually.

##How does it work
